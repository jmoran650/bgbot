Combat Order:
    Player with more minions attacks first, otherwise coin flip to determine

    Start of combat effects take place left to right

    From there, minions attack left to right UNLESS hero power to attack first

    Functionalities to think about: 
        When attacking, a minion must always choose from taunted minions when there are taunted minions on the board

        Summons must only trigger when there is space on the board, reborns trigger after Summons i.e. eternal summoner

        Certain battlecries must be able to trigger in combat
