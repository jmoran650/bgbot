# of copies of minion by each tier,

# of copies determines chance to roll

choose each minion one by one from the pool when a player rolls and decrement each card rolled accordingly.

If a player rolls a card and does not buy it increment it to return that copy back to the pool.

If a player buys a card keep the decrement until the card is sold. Selling a golden counts for as many of the cards in the golden as were bought, copies dont count



Minion in pool has attributes {tier, tribe, }

{tier, tribe } : {minion}

roll{tier, tribes}{
    draw only minions from this tier and below and of these tribes
}
